            <h2>Use Cases</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Real-Time Route Recommendation</h3>
                <p>The system calculates the shortest or most comfortable route by analyzing train schedules, travel times, and crowd density. It dynamically updates the recommendation if a train becomes overcrowded or delayed.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Crowd Management</h3>
                <p>Real-time monitoring of passenger density at stations and on trains. It prioritizes trains with lower crowd density to maintain balance across the network.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Multi-Modal Commute Integration</h3>
                <p>The system can be further integrated with the train, metro, and bus networks to suggest the best multi-modal route. Seamless integration with other transport modes (e.g., buses, auto-rickshaws).</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Tourists Traveling in Unfamiliar Cities</h3>
                <p>The system provides an end-to-end plan, including train options, transfer points, and approximate crowd levels.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Infrastructure and Safety</h3>
                <p>Better station design for smooth passenger flow and entry/exit management. Safe and efficient redirection of commuters during emergencies. The system reroutes commuters via alternate lines, adjusting travel times during any track maintenance.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Cost-Effective Commute Options</h3>
                <p>Reducing operational costs with better energy management and optimized train schedules. It prioritizes routes with lower ticket prices while considering travel time and crowd density and calculates costs for specific routes.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Reducing Carbon Footprint</h3>
                <p>Reduced carbon footprint through better utilization of public transport. Solar panels at stations to reduce reliance on conventional energy.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Long-Distance Travel Optimization</h3>
                <p>It recommends whether to take a local train to Lonavala and then an intercity train to Pune or travel directly by express train. The system identifies the best train options, factoring in real-time delays, crowd levels, and connections.</p>
